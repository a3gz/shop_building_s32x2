**Welcome to OfficeBuildingS32x2, the Free Open Source office building for Second Life and Open Simulator**.

I created this building becase I wanted to maximize the available space in a 32x32 parcel.
Eventually I found a great building in the Marketplace that fit but it only covered half the available surface. Larger bulding were longer than 32meters on one side or the other.

I decided to build a custom building with the following characteristics:

  * Fit inside a 32x32 parce.
  * Cover as much of the available space with shop surface while leaving some room for landing space and outdoors area.
  * Isolate my parcel as much as possible from whatever the neighbors do with theirs.

## What's inside

This repository contains everything: the whole versioning history of blend files, baked AO s, UV-layouts, collada files ready to import to SL or OS and the final textures I created for my own use.

The building can be used as-is or as a start point to make something better.

## What can you do with this?

Do whatever you want with this **except** put it for sale. This can be used as a learning tool or to setaup your own shop or showroom. **Just please, don't turn it into a product**.
