**Welcome to OfficeBuildingS32x2, the Free Open Source shop building for Second Life and Open Simulator**.

*(This is a Shop building, I named it wrong and now it's too late to fix it)*

I created this building becase I wanted to maximize the available space in a 32x32 parcel.
Eventually I found a great building in the Marketplace that fit but it only covered half the available surface. Larger bulding were longer than 32meters on one side or the other.

I decided to build a custom building with the following characteristics:

  * Fit inside a 32x32 parce.
  * Cover as much of the available space with shop surface while leaving some room for landing space and outdoors area.
  * Isolate my parcel as much as possible from whatever the neighbors do with theirs.

## What's inside

  * Blender files. The whole versioning history of `.blend` files. **Blender 3.0**.
  * UV-layout files.
  * Baked AOs. But you can bake your own by changing the settings.
  * Collada files. Ready to import to SL or OS.
  * Textures I created for my own use.

The building can be used as-is or as a start point to make something better.

## What can you do with this?

Do whatever you want with this **except** put it for sale. This can be used as a learning tool or to setaup your own shop or showroom. **Just please, don't turn it into a product**.

## Upload cost
